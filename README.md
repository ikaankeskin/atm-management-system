Need to add current date rather than promting the user under system.c


Instructions:

You can only do this on a Linux, Unix system so no Windows.
go to the atm-management-system folder and just type 'make' as a command
this should compile the code and give you an executable file. 

run the command ./atm to start the program.

Enjoy your account experience!
